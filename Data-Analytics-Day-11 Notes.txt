Topics & Explanations:
=====================

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing in Python:
==========================
What it is: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format.

Why it matters: Dirty or inconsistent data leads to wrong insights.

Example:

Removing duplicate customer entries in an e-commerce dataset.

Handling missing Age values by filling them with the median.

Key steps: Removing nulls, standardizing formats, scaling numeric data.

2️⃣ Handling Missing Data (Pandas):
=============================
What it is: Filling, replacing, or dropping missing values.

Techniques:

dropna() → Remove missing rows/columns.

fillna(value) → Replace missing with a fixed value.

mean() / median() imputation.

Example: Replacing missing Salary values in HR data with the average salary.

3️⃣ Data Transformation (Scaling & Encoding):
=====================================
Scaling: Ensuring numerical features are in the same range (MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler).

Encoding: Converting categorical values into numeric (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).

Example: Transforming Country column (India, USA, UK) into binary columns for ML models.

4️⃣ Outlier Detection & Treatment:
============================
What it is: Identifying values that deviate drastically from the rest.

Techniques:

IQR method

Z-score method

Example: In a sales dataset, finding if Quantity has unusually large numbers that may be due to data entry errors.

5️⃣ Feature Engineering Basics:
=========================
What it is: Creating new features from existing data to improve models.

Example: From a Date column, extracting Day of Week or Month for sales trend analysis.

Impact: Often boosts predictive accuracy and makes insights more meaningful.
